# This folder contains all scripts of correlation analyses, past and future autumn phenology predictions, model performance analyses, and related output

### The subfolder contains the following documents and scripts:
- Codes:
	- ModelAnalyses_1_Correlation&PathAnalyses_Figures1.r: analysing correlations between autumn phenology drivers and leaf senescence dates, and generating related figures (outputs: Fig. 1ABC, Fig. S1, Fig. S2).
	- ModelAnalyses_2_Process_models_HPC.r: calibrating parameters for the 10 models at the timeseries-level and estimating leaf senescence dates for 1948-2015 (outputs: Process_model_predictions.csv).
	- ModelAnalyses_3_Figures_process_models.r: evaluating the 10 process-based autumn phenology models, validating the photosynthesis model, and generating related figures (outputs: Fig. 3).
	- ModelAnalyses_4_AutumnPhenology_FutureProjections_Figures3.r: predicting leaf senescence dates for 2016-2100, and generating related figures (outputs: Fig. 4, Fig. S7, Fig. S8, Fig. S9).
