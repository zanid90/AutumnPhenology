# This repository contains the code used for the analyses in the paper "Increased growing season productivity drives earlier autumn leaf senescence in temperate trees"

### The code is organized as follows:
- The folder titled "AutumnPhenology_Data&Metadata" contains data (and related code scripts) on:
	- All phenological records used in the study and related locations. 
	- Past (1948-2015) and future (2016-2100) drivers of autumn leaf phenology for all timeseries.

- The folder titled "AutumnPhenology_Models&Analyses" contains code scripts (and related outputs) for:
	- Analysing correlations between autumn phenology drivers and leaf senescence dates.
	- Calibrating parameters and estimating leaf senescence dates at the timeseries-level of 10 process-based autumn phenology models for 1948-2015. 
	- Evaluating the performance of the 10 models.
	- Predicting leaf senescence dates and growing season length of all timeseries for 2016-2100 with 6 selected models.
